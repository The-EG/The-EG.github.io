# So, this is it.

I thought it good to begin by explaining what's up with my handle: The-EG. 

As you may have guessed by now, 'EG' is short for 'evil genius.'

# Evil? Genius? Who would choose that?

I wouldn't choose that, and I didn't, actually. I'm a firm believer that you can't choose your own nickname.

This all started about 14 years ago.

My supervisor, a few coworkers and I had been working long hours for multiple days trying to meet a regulatory deadline. Early one morning, at the end of a particularly long day that had started the day before, we were all noting what projects had been reviewed and by whom.

I had a reputation for solving problems others couldn't, and my supervisor found it amusing to work Spongebob Squarepants references into work, so I quickly became 'Plankton' and then later 'the evil genius,' again in reference to the character.

On that day, probably due to lack of sleep, I thought it would be funny to sign all of my projects with 'EG.' 

My supervisor _loved_ it. 

She started introducing me to others within the company as 'The EG.'

# It stuck.

I wasn't just known within my company as that. When I took a new job, at a new company, several states away, it followed me. Even some of our government auditors know me as 'The EG.'

At that point, I decided I may as well use it. I used it on sites where I may not want to use my real name, but I didn't mind if those that I knew closely enough to know my nickname would realize it was me. Later, I realized it was a part of my identity.

So, I am The Evil Genius.
